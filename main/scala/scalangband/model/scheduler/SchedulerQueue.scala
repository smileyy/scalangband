/**
 * A doubly linked list of creatures, used for the scheduling system. This acts like a priority queue, with the head of
 * the queue ebing the creature with the most energy. Inserting a new creature places the creature at the end then
 * bubbles it up to the appropriate place in the queue. This (probably?) has an advantage over a heap-based priority
 * queue in that poll is O(1) instead of O(log N). However, the real advantage comes in typical use where a creature
 * being re-enqueued will typically be coming in with a minimal amount of energy, most likely the least energy of all
 * other creatures in the queue, resulting in typically O(1) re-queue, with the worst case of O(N). A disadvantage is
 * that initial construction is something like O(N-squared) vs. O(N logN) for a priority queue.
 *
 * @param first the node containing the creature with the most energy. In general, this should not be read directly
 *              when returning results; instead use `getFirst`
 * @param last the
